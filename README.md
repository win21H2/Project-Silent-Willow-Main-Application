<h6 align="center">^ different versions of the application (Note they were taken on different days) ^</h6>
<h3 align="center">What is it and what is it used for?</h3>
<h6 align="center">This is an open-source control application for Project Silent Willow using Android Studio and Kotlin as the main language. Although the user interface might suggest other uses, please only use for controlling Project Silent Willow as I have no control over other third party products or services</h6>
<h3 align="center">Why did I want to custom make this application?</h3>
<h6 align="center">The main reason why I wanted to custom make it is because I was originally using MIT App Inventor (AI2) and I saw that there was not much in terms of how much I could customize how stuff looked/worked etc. and I wanted to have full control over what was in the app/how it functioned</h6>
<h3 align="center">Where can I find sample code?</h3>
<h6 align="center">If you want to find sample code, head over to -->Arduino<br>You can find Project Silent Willows main control code in -->Arduino -->ProjectSilentWillowControlMain.cpp<br> or sample code for a 1 digit 7 segment display in -->Arduino -->incomingdata.ino</h6>
