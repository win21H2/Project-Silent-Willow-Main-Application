<h1 align="center">Project Silent Willow's control application</h1>
<h3 align="center">What is it used for?</h3>
<h6 align="center">As suggested in the title, this is an open-source control application for Project Silent Willow using Android studio and Kotlin as the main language</h6>
<h3 align="center">Why did I want to custom make this application?</h3>
<h6 align="center">The main reason why I wanted to custom make it is because I was originally using MIT App Inventor (AI2) and I saw that there was not much in terms of how much I could customize how stuff looked/worked etc. and I wanted to have full control over what was in the app/how it functioned</h6>
